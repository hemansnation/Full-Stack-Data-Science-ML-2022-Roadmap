# Full-Stack-DataScience-ML-Roadmap

I completed my Master of Technology in Data Science, no doubt it is an amazing field. I studied 18 different subjects, completed 1 Thesis, and 1 capstone project in my 2 years of MTech journey.

With all those subjects I am able to build a roadmap for all those who want to get a kick start as Data Scientist.

If you don't want to spend 2 years on a master's degree but want to learn on your own, this will be the best roadmap for you. It will give you a bird' eye view of where you are now and where you want to be in the future.

The roadmap is divided into 12 sections


1. Python Programming and Logic Building
2. Data Structure & Algorithms
3. Pandas Numpy Matplotlib
4. Statistics
5. Machine Learning
6. Natural Language Processing
7. Computer Vision with PyTorch
8. Data Visualization with Tableau
9. Structure Query Language (SQL)
10. Big Data and PySpark
11. Development Operations with Azure
12. Five Major Projects and Git
